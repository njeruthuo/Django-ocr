# OCR-APP-1

I created this application to solve a problem that I was experiencing. My lecturer sent an Image file with assignments instead of a PDF.
So I had to create a solution that could allow me to copy the text and paste it to learning tools such as ChatGPT.
This is where my journey with OCR(optical character recognition) started.
