b) Consider a single server queuing system. The system starts at time t=0. The
arrival time of customers is: 0.9, 1.3, 2.8, 3.1, 3.8, 8.0, 8.6, 9.0, 9.2, and 9.8. The departure times are: 2.2, 4.0, 5.0, 6.4, and 11.0. Time is in minutes. The first in first out queuing discipline is followed. Simulate this system for six clients and estimate:

i) The average delay in the waiting line

ii) The average number of clients in the waiting line at any timet

iii) The expected utilization of server. (11 Marks)
